"Randomly zero out entire channels independently with probability :math:`p`. "
"This layer expects the channels to be last, i.e., the input shape should be "
"`NDHWC` or `DHWC` where: `N` is the batch dimension, `D` is the depth, `H` "
"is the input image height, `W` is the input image width, and `C` is the "
"number of input channels."

"The remaining channels are scaled by :math:`\\frac{1}{1-p}` to maintain the "
"expected value of each element. Unlike traditional dropout, which zeros "
"individual entries, this layer zeros entire channels. This is often "
"beneficial for convolutional layers processing 3D data, like in medical "
"imaging or video processing."
