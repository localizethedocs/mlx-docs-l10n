"There are three upsampling algorithms implemented nearest neighbor "
"upsampling, linear interpolation, and cubic interpolation. All can be "
"applied to any number of spatial dimensions. The linear interpolation will "
"be bilinear, trilinear etc when applied to more than one spatial dimension. "
"And cubic interpolation will be bicubic when there are 2 spatial dimensions."
