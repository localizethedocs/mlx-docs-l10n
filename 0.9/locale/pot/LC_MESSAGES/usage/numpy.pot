"The function ``f`` indirectly modifies the array ``x`` through a memory "
"view. However, this modification is not reflected in the gradient, as seen "
"in the last line outputting ``1.0``, representing the gradient of the sum "
"operation alone. The squaring of ``x`` occurs externally to MLX, meaning "
"that no gradient is incorporated. It's important to note that a similar "
"issue arises during array conversion and copying. For instance, a function "
"defined as ``mx.array(np.array(x)**2).sum()`` would also result in an "
"incorrect gradient, even though no in-place operations on MLX memory are "
"executed."
