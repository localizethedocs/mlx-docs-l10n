"MLX is a NumPy-like array framework designed for efficient and flexible "
"machine learning on Apple silicon, brought to you by Apple machine learning "
"research."

"The Python API closely follows NumPy with a few exceptions. MLX also has a "
"fully featured C++ API which closely follows the Python API."

"The design of MLX is inspired by frameworks like `PyTorch <https://pytorch."
"org/>`_, `Jax <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, and `ArrayFire <https://"
"arrayfire.org/>`_. A notable difference from these frameworks and MLX is the "
"*unified memory model*. Arrays in MLX live in shared memory. Operations on "
"MLX arrays can be performed on any of the supported device types without "
"performing data copies. Currently supported device types are the CPU and GPU."
