"Randomly zero out entire channels independently with probability :math:`p`. "
"This layer expects the channels to be last, i.e. the input shape should be "
"``NWHC`` or ``WHC`` where:``N`` is the batch dimension,``H`` is the input "
"image height,``W`` is the input image width, and``C`` is the number of input "

"The remaining channels are scaled by :math:`\\frac{1}{1-p}` to maintain the "
"expected value of each element. Unlike traditional dropout, which zeros "
"individual entries, this layer zeros entire channels. This is beneficial for "
"early convolution layers where adjacent pixels are correlated. In such case, "
"traditional dropout may not effectively regularize activations. For more "
"details, see [1]."
